This folder contains multiple scripts, and here is a short description
of their content:

1) Matrix_SVD_Decomp_with_PCA - This script performs SVD decomp
on the data entered into the data_NA_Project script (the data_NA_project
script is called), and then it performs PCA on the data as well.  
a) data_NA_Project loads data from the SNAP_Data_2.csv file included
in this folder.  
b) The SNAP_Data_2.csv file has no headings.  Therefore, if you would
like to see the variable names, see the SNAP_Data.csv file.

2) PCA_Algorithm_Covariance_Matrix_Complete - This script performs the 
traditional PCA procedure with the covariance matrix
on the data entered into the data_NA_Project script (the data_NA_project
script is called).  
a) data_NA_Project loads data from the SNAP_Data_2.csv file included
in this folder.  
b) The SNAP_Data_2.csv file has no headings.  Therefore, if you would
like to see the variable names, see the SNAP_Data.csv file.

3) SVD3D_Images - This script performs SVD on images (and deals with 3D
images!), and then you can see how including different numbers of singular
values will affect the image quality.
a) You can choose different images (Spice_1, Charlie_1, and Tucker_1)
but, for speed, you might want to start with Charlie_1.


*To run the scripts in this folder, make sure that this folder is
your 'directory' in MATLAB.
